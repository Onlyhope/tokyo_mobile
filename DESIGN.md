Tagging exercise exercise records with a workout ID
- This will make it simple to group exercise records into workout ID
- At the same time we can analyze exercise records by their created time.
- Extra complexity is tagging the correct exercise records with the ID.

For creating a workout we can simply show a list of today's workouts.
This number is usually going to be one. Give the option to add an additional workout,
if necessary.

If there are more than two workouts on the screen than hide or collapse the oldest ones.

On navigating to the create work-out page we should always show today's workout, if there's one.
- If there isn't we show an empty page.
- If there is a workout over-extended from yesterday, we do not show it.
